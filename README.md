# Database_Table_Creator

This Python code creates a graphical user interface designed to create and manage MySQL databases and tables. The interface allows users to input necessary database connection details, define column names and data types, and generate databases and tables with just a few clicks.

By automating these tasks, the application reduces the need for manual SQL scripting, enabling users, even those without extensive technical skills, to handle database-related tasks efficiently. This can be particularly beneficial for businesses looking to streamline their data management processes, as it speeds up the creation and modification of databases and reduces the likelihood of human error. It also lets you add another layer of security by using API tokens so that access comes from that program. If the credentials of the database are leaked they wonâ€™t have access to it unless they have either local access, which might have other issues,  or the API token.
